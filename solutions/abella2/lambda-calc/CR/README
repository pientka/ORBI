This is obviously a R version proof, which does *NOT* use minimal
relations. In particular it uses a ternary relation relting is_tm to pr1 to cd1, 

Define xpcdR : olist -> olist -> olist -> prop by
  xpcdR nil nil nil ;
  nabla x, xpcdR (is_tm x :: L) (pr1 x x :: K) (cd1 x x :: notabs x :: J) :=
    xpcdR L K J.

rather than

inductive Rxrt: {g:xrG} {h:xcdG} prop =
| Rxrt_nil : Rxrt [] []
| Rxrt_cons: Rxrt [g] [h] ->
            Rxrt [g, b:block x:tm, u:pr x x][h, b:block x:tm,  nlx : notlam x , v:cd x x];

This avoids a fair amount of promotion lemmas but no reasonable
directive is likely to syntesize the former form the latter.
